## Why Encryption Matters

### Application Level Encryption
Encrypting data-at-rest is a fundamental security practice to prevent unauthorized access to your database. Application-level encryption offers an additional layer of protection for sensitive attributes stored in your application.

### Benefits of Application Level Encryption
- **Enhanced Security:** By encrypting sensitive attributes, even if a security breach occurs and an attacker gains access to your database or application logs, the encrypted data remains incomprehensible.
- **Prevention of Data Exposure:** Encryption helps mitigate the risk of unintentional exposure of users' sensitive information in application logs or other system components.
- **Granular Data Control:** With application-level encryption, you have the flexibility to define and control what data is considered sensitive within your application code. This granular control extends to various aspects of data access and manipulation.
