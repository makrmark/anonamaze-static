# Transparent Anonymisation

**Protecting Your Privacy, One Conversation at a Time.**

Safeguarding your private and confidential information has never been easier. Our innovative technology ensures that your sensitive data remains secure through automatic and transparent anonymization in your chats.

## How Does Transparent Anonymisation Work?

Transparent anonymization is designed to provide a seamless and secure chatting experience. The process begins by identifying suspected sensitive words within the conversation. Once these words are detected, our system automatically tags them for anonymization. 

Anonymization works by substituting the suspected sensitive phrase with a random unguessable string, which is then sent to the A.I. model. The A.I. model understands these random strings represent anonymized content and will return them unchanged. AnonAmaze then restores these anonymized strings back to their original format for the user. This ensures that your sensitive information is protected without compromising the flow of your conversations.
