# Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

---

## What is DLP?
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) refers to a set of tools and strategies designed to protect organizations from the risk of data breaches and leaks. DLP solutions help prevent sensitive data, such as confidential files, financial records, or customer information, from being shared, intentionally or unintentionally, outside the organization's secure environment.

## Why is DLP a problem for organizations?
Data loss can have severe consequences for organizations, including financial losses, damage to reputation, legal repercussions, and loss of customer trust. With the increasing volume of data being generated and shared within organizations, the risk of data loss through human error, malicious intent, or external threats is a significant concern.
