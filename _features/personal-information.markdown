# Protect Your Identity While Chatting with AI

**Safeguard Your Identity, Ensure Your Privacy**

At AnonAmaze, we prioritize safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the protection of your identity. Here's how we ensure that your personal information remains confidential and secure:

## Minimal Data Collection

We operate on a strict principle - we can't share what we don't collect. The only piece of identifying information we ask you for is your email address, which is required for logging into AnonAmaze. We do not share any other personal details like your name, IP address, or location with AI providers.

## Secure AI Integration

When partnering with our GenAI providers, we authenticate using a generic API key. This process ensures that our AI provider remains unaware of your identity or organizational affiliation. Furthermore, they are unable to access your IP address or geographical location, reinforcing the confidentiality of your data.

## Enhanced Privacy Controls

For added versatility, you have the option to input any personal information that you wish to be automatically anonymized within your chat messages, such as your name, email address, or phone number. This feature provides further control and assurance over what is shared with our AI providers.

## Why Personal Information and Privacy Matter

In today's digital landscape, personal information is more valuable than ever. Your data, including details like your name, email address, IP address, and location, can reveal sensitive aspects of your identity. At AnonAmaze, we recognize the significance of protecting this information and understand the importance of maintaining your privacy.

## Note

Depending on the AI provider, AnonAmaze may share a SHA256 cryptographic hash of your email address, which is provided to aid in support purposes. This non-reversable cryptographic hash ensures that your email remains protected and unidentifiable throughout our operations.
