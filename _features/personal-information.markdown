# Protect Your Identity
**Safeguard Your Identity, Ensure Your Privacy**


At **AnonAmaze**, we prioritize safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the protection of your identity. Here's how we ensure that your personal information remains confidential and secure:

### How We Protect Your Identity

1. **Minimal Data Collection**: We operate on a strict principle - we can't share what we don't collect. The only piece of identifying information we retain is your email address, which is required for logging into AnonAmaze. We do not gather or retransmit any other personal details like your name, IP address, or location in our database.

2. **Secure AI Integration**: When partnering with our GenAI provider, we authenticate using a generic API key. This process guarantees that our AI provider remains oblivious to your identity or organizational affiliation. Furthermore, they are unable to access your IP address or geographical location, reinforcing the confidentiality of your data.

3. **Enhanced Privacy Controls**: For added versatility, you have the option to input any personal information that you wish to be automatically anonymized within your chat messages, such as your name, email address, or phone number. This feature provides further control and assurance over what is shared with our AI providers.

### Note

The only personal information AnonAmaze shares with our AI partner is a SHA256 cryptographic hash of your email address, which is provided to aid in support purposes. This non-reversable cryptographic hash ensures that your email remains protected and unidentifiable throughout our operations.

Your privacy is our utmost priority at AnonAmaze. Join us in our commitment to protecting your identity and engaging in secure interactions online.
